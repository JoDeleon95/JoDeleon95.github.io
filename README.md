*Introduction
"Hello, my name is Josh, I would like to become an Software Developer and get into a career with a Tech Company, but at some point I would also love to go down entrepreneurial route and create my own business and build Applications that would help real life situations and the every day user.

*Passion Project
What I mainly focus all my brain power on is my family, and two children. They are my passion project they are the reason I get up every day and work my hardest so they can enjoy life. I have to use a lot of logic and reasoning when with them as they are new into this world they don't know how things work and why things are the way they are. They are given so many choices at such young ages I must have patience and the willingness to teach and learn at the same time. I must ease them into this world through my teachings and beliefs to hope they will grow up to be better than me. They make me open my mind and see the bigger picture, that time flies by fast and to take advantage to seize your moment.

*Quantitatiive
5 years in a customer service oriented enviornment.
4 years realated in tech sales.
Highly proficient with mathematics.

*Qualitative
Honest and devoted.
Work with proficient time management.
Proficient verbal and communication skills.

*Golden Circle
WHY :  To help make tasks on the evry day user much more convenient or life changing.
HOW : By learning the code and becoming proficient in the coding languages.
WHAT: Develop multiple applications that would assist the user in their tasks such as health advice, event tracker, or grocery list etc.. the idea is to be able to mkae the day to day tasks easier.

*Week 1
After completing my first week my mind is scrambling all over the place but I do myself learning and getting better day by day. I just have to remind myself not to give up and to utilize my resources around me. The java language is very tough to learn but as with any language it can still be learned. It's just going to take a long of patience and determination.
