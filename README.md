*Introduction:
"Hello, my name is Josh, I would like to become an Software Developer and get into a career with a Tech Company, but at some point I would also love to go down entrepreneurial route and create my own business and build Applications that would help real life situations and the every day user.

*Passion Project:
What I mainly focus all my brain power on is my family, and two children. They are my passion project they are the reason I get up every day and work my hardest so they can enjoy life. I have to use a lot of logic and reasoning when with them as they are new into this world they don't know how things work and why things are the way they are. They are given so many choices at such young ages I must have patience and the willingness to teach and learn at the same time. I must ease them into this world through my teachings and beliefs to hope they will grow up to be better than me. They make me open my mind and see the bigger picture, that time flies by fast and to take advantage to seize your moment.

*Quantitatiive:
5 years in a customer service oriented enviornment.
4 years realated in tech sales.
Highly proficient with mathematics.

*Qualitative:
Honest and devoted.
Work with proficient time management.
Proficient verbal and communication skills.

*Golden Circle:
WHY :  To help make tasks on the evry day user much more convenient or life changing.
HOW : By learning the code and becoming proficient in the coding languages.
WHAT: Develop multiple applications that would assist the user in their tasks such as health advice, event tracker, or grocery list etc.. the idea is to be able to mkae the day to day tasks easier.

*Week 1 Reflection:
After completing my first week my mind is scrambling all over the place but I do myself learning and getting better day by day. I just have to remind myself not to give up and to utilize my resources around me. The java language is very tough to learn but as with any language it can still be learned. It's just going to take a long of patience and determination.

*Write a paragraph about how your two pictures connect:
My two photos connect in a very interesting way. If you were to look at the photos they would look like two very random things that don't seem like they would go together but if you look deeper you see more than that. My photos were of a vulture flying and two fully cooked sausages.Very random, but I see these photos connecting because I see myself as both the vulture and the sausages. The vulture is me now, spreading my wings and flying on a journey with a motive in mind, I'm a vulture I'm hungry always looking for my next meal and going that extra mile to satisfy that hunger. The sausages are me in the future, I'm prepped and fully cooked ready to go. Im right where I need to be but I'm still missing the rest of my entree, I need to focus and keep working to finish my meal and get where I want to be. These photos symbolize the steps of where I am now and where I want to be in a few years. Itâ€™s all about following a process and staying motivated and not letting any distractions deter me from completing my entree to become successful.

*Week 2 Reflection:
After the end of my 2 weeks I can see myself slowly but surely starting to learn the content. We had our first quiz this past week and I was pretty confident. Although you could take the Quiz as many times as possible, I was able to get the passing score on the 3rd attempt which to me is making progress. If I were to have attempted this Quiz my first week it would have probably took way more than 3 tries. Also we did have our first ProDevLab meeting upstairs where we were introduced to some of the people CNM Ingenuity works with as well as past DeepDive students and some neat projects they had. Really got me excited to see how I'll be at the end of this program!
