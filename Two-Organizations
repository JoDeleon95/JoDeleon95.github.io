# Name of two Organizations:

* For my first organization I see a big tech need which would actually be a mobile applicarion and that would be
for the well known Blakes Lotaburger. Big local fast food restaurant and from a personal experience they are known
to get extremely busy. That being said i think a mobile application would be good to minimize the phone orders and 
it would help make the ordering process alot more smooth and easier on the employees. 

My approach would be to call the main location and ask to meet up maybe have a coffee. I would make it known how important 
their time is and wouldn't want to waste that. I would gather info basically on how they feel their stores run and how the 
ordering process and what they do about an abundance amount of phone orders. I could then ask them how they thinka mobile
application would make their day to day tasks easier.
