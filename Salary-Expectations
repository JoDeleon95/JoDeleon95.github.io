# Salary Expectations :
I did some research and my expectations were pretty low to what I found. For a Junior Software Developer, the avergae salary
is $60,000 - $68,000. My expectations were more to like $45,000 and I know that Albuquerque is going to grow even more in the 
Tech Industry and will bring more jobs. Given the fact that I am starting with very little experience to the coding world I 
do see most tech companies starting at $45,000 and even that's a good start just to get my foot in the door and grow with 
the company as well as myself and gain that experience and more knowledge to just help better and furhter my career.
